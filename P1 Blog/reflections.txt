Through this part’s learning, I have a brief understanding of what HTML is and what’s the relationship between HTML and browsers. HTML is a markup language which defines the whole structure of the webpage and it’s nothing but boxes. In addition, I learned how to translate a particular mock up to HTML document. Unlike other programming languages, it shows results immediately, which interested me a lot. During the process of learning, I found it was easy to position the tags like <div>, <h1> and so on. However, it has been difficult for me to understand and use the relative path, which I fully understand now. In term of challenges of this project, since I learned some HTML before so it is not difficult for me.
